# Week 2

### Project title:
_Birthday Tracker_

### Project Description:
This week, students will use the Alexa Skills console to add on to the skill they created in week 1. They will use a systems function API to retrieve the user's current time to compare it to the user's birthday.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Understand system function APIs and how to use them
- Incorporate an API into the skill we created in week 1

### List of Needed Technologies:
- ASK (Alexa Skills Kit)
- AWS account (free accounts are fine here)
- AWS Lambda function (this is under the hood, managed indirectly through the Alexa console)

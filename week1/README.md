# Week 1

### Project title:
_Why doesn't my robot like me_

### Project Description:
This week, students will use the Alexa Skills console to create a skill from a template, and learn what the components of an Alexa skill are. This will generally follow the first few tutorials of the http://developer.amazon.com guide.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Get familiar with the console, the components of an Alexa app
- Be able to manage the data used for the simple skill provided in the template
  - i.e. change the response that Alexa says from the same prompt

### List of Needed Technologies:
- ASK (Alexa Skills Kit)
- AWS account (free accounts are fine here)
- AWS Lambda function (this is under the hood, managed indirectly through the Alexa console)
